This is where I write about my thoughts and my [experience](http://www.linkedin.com/in/ajayarn).

I currently work on Operations Research problems at Bain and Company. Previously, I was an OR / Data Scientist at Coupang, and a lead OR scientist at Quintiq.

### Why?
I was so busy seeing if I could, I never stopped to think if I should. 

I am inspired by luminaries such as [Paul Graham](http://paulgraham.com/) and [Joel Spolsky](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/). I might never reach the heights of clarity and vision they have, but it doesn't hurt to try.



### Apropos of nothing

>न त्वं देहो न ते देहो भोक्ता कर्ता न वा भवान् ।  
> चिद्रूपोऽसि सदा साक्षी निरपेक्षः सुखं चर ॥ ४ ॥
>
> You are not the body, nor is the body yours, nor are you the doer of actions or the reaper of their consequences. You are eternally pure consciousness the witness, in need of nothing - so live happily.

[Ashtavakra Gita verse 15.4](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/ashtavakra-gita-sanskrit/d/doc345938.html)
