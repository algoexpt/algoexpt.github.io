## The void 

When I was younger, I was greatly seduced by the idea that I could be a 
(vastly) improved version of myself if only I could read and internalize 
the contents of self-help books. 

It took a long time for me to realize that I was
left unfulfilled, to realize
that nothing external could improve my life.
Not advice, not money, not even the love of someone. 

I had to try to accept myself, and to try to live
in the present as much as possible.

It's better to stop here before I write something cringeworthy (oops too late).
These things are easy to say and bloody hard to actually live by.

## The lure of better tools 

I found myself this morning installing
[Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com/#), because there are stories of people
saying they "changed their life around" using the zettelkasten method
(here's an
[example](https://www.bryanlee.net/blog/the-life-changing-magic-of-zettelkasten)).
Apparently it's the way to become 20% smarter and win Pulitzers.

Please don't pay any attention to my cynical tone. It's because I can't
get any value from it myself. Yet. 

A great hammer in the hands of a master carpenter is going to save him
time and effort and possibly allow him to make better furniture than if he
didn't have it. He is understandably going to be excited. "This tool", he
says, "will allow you to make a four poster bed like never before and in
just 3 days!".

Then a poor doofus like myself  comes around with no talent in carpentry
but plenty of ambition and desire, and I think to myself: _"Hey, the
reason I am not a master carpenter is because I don't have this tool yet.
But what do you know - it's only $30, so I'm going to buy it and look at
me go!"_

So I buy the tool but I still can't make anything better than the dumb
chair I used to make before  I had the hammer. 

Eh? Where's the 4 poster bed? Where's the fame and the world's 
recognition of my talent? 

Time goes by, the hammer rusts, and in my old age I regret, "If only I had
_this other tool_, I would have been the best carpenter in the world."

You get my point. It's not the tool. It's the hand that wields, the brain
that thinks, the person who uses the tool. Advice helps, but the person
receiving advice must be ready. It's not about the advice itself.

## How to get better 

How do we get better?  

### Want it "badly enough"

The "it" here should be something concrete. Not
"I want to be rich" but "I want $10000 in 3
months".

Badly enough that we don't care about self-help. Badly enough that we are
laser focused on the (singular) goal we want to achieve.

Then tools and techniques will be insignificant, just a means to an end. They'll
be the minor improvements that smoothen our progress, but not goals in
and of themselves. We'll have perspective, a framework where everything
fits or is thrown away.

### Fail

Failure sharpens our senses. It gives us some motivation to
make us "_want something badly enough_". We are better aware of where we are
lacking and what needs to be done, what questions to ask, and what tools
to use.

Sometimes I wait for failure, especially when I am missing the spark.
Some part of me  is telling me I am not doing enough, and I want to
self-destruct. I think it's good to fail in small ways. 

### Let go

Something counter-intuitive: we'll get better or worse or stay the same 
and there's nothing we can do about it. We should stop wasting our time on trying 
to get better and just _be_ better. Work, live clean, sleep well, do our best and forget about
it.

Realize that reading this for the last 5 - 10 minutes has not improved
your life even a miniscule bit. Go do something.
