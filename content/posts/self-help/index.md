It took a long time for me to realize that I couldn't improve myself by
reading self help books. My insecure self was hyper sensitive to my
shortcomings and the superiority of others. I felt I could be better with
some magic key, with that one piece of advice that would fill the void in
my soul.

But it doesn't work like that. Nothing external can improve our lives by
itself. Not advice, not money, not even the love of someone. _WE_ fill our
own void, by accepting who we are and finding satisfaction in the present,
and by _making something of what is given_.

I'll stop here. These things are easy to say and bloody hard to
actually live by.

I found myself this morning installing [Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com/#), 
because there are stories of people saying they "changed their life
around" using the zettelkasten method (here's an
[example](https://www.bryanlee.net/blog/the-life-changing-magic-of-zettelkasten)).
Apparently it's the way to become 20% smarter and write amazing books...

Please don't pay any attention to my cynical tone. It's because I can't
get any value from it myself. Yet. 

Why do I say this?

A great hammer in the hands of a master carpenter is going to save him
time and effort and possibly allow him to make better furniture than if he
didn't have it. He is understandably going to be excited. "This tool", he
says, "will allow you to make a four poster bed like never before and in
just 3 days!".

Then a poor schmuck like myself  comes around with no talent in carpentry
but plenty of ambition and desire, and I think to myself: _"Hey, the
reason I am not a master carpenter is because I don't have this tool yet.
But what do you know - it's only $30, so I'm going to buy it and look at
me go!"_

So I buy the tool but I still can't make anything better than the dumb
chair I used to make before  I had the hammer. 

Eh? Where's the 4 poster bed? Where's the fame and the world's 
recognition of my talent? 

Time goes by, the hammer rusts, and in my old age I regret, "If only I had
_this other tool_, I would have been the best carpenter in the world."

You get my point. It's not the tool. It's the hand that wields, the brain
that thinks, the person who uses the tool.

Can't fill that void with things from outside yourself.
