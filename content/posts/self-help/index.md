## The void 
It took a long time for me to realize that I couldn't improve myself by
reading self-help books. My insecure self was hyper sensitive to my
shortcomings and the superiority of others. I felt I could be better with
some magic key, with that one piece of advice that would fill the void in
my soul.

But it doesn't work like that. Nothing external can improve our lives by
itself. Not advice, not money, not even the love of someone. _WE_ fill our
own void, by accepting who we are and finding satisfaction in the present,
and by _making something of what is given_.

I'll stop here. These things are easy to say and bloody hard to
actually live by.

## The lure of better tools 

I found myself this morning installing
[Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com/#), because there are stories of people
saying they "changed their life around" using the zettelkasten method
(here's an
[example](https://www.bryanlee.net/blog/the-life-changing-magic-of-zettelkasten)).
Apparently it's the way to become 20% smarter and win Pulitzers.

Please don't pay any attention to my cynical tone. It's because I can't
get any value from it myself. Yet. 

Why do I say this?

A great hammer in the hands of a master carpenter is going to save him
time and effort and possibly allow him to make better furniture than if he
didn't have it. He is understandably going to be excited. "This tool", he
says, "will allow you to make a four poster bed like never before and in
just 3 days!".

Then a poor schmuck like myself  comes around with no talent in carpentry
but plenty of ambition and desire, and I think to myself: _"Hey, the
reason I am not a master carpenter is because I don't have this tool yet.
But what do you know - it's only $30, so I'm going to buy it and look at
me go!"_

So I buy the tool but I still can't make anything better than the dumb
chair I used to make before  I had the hammer. 

Eh? Where's the 4 poster bed? Where's the fame and the world's 
recognition of my talent? 

Time goes by, the hammer rusts, and in my old age I regret, "If only I had
_this other tool_, I would have been the best carpenter in the world."

You get my point. It's not the tool. It's the hand that wields, the brain
that thinks, the person who uses the tool. Advice helps, but the person
receiving advice must be ready. It's not about the advice itself.

Can't fill that void with things from outside yourself.

## How to get better 

How do we get better? And am I saying that we should
ignore all external help? 


The sure way to get better is to want something concrete "badly
enough".

If you have to wonder how much is enough, then it's not enough. Badly
enough that you don't care about self-help. Badly enough that you are
laser focused on the (singular) goal you want to achieve.

Then tools like zettlr will be a blip in the path to improvement. They'll
be the minor improvements that smoothen your progress, but not goals in
and of themselves. You'll have perspective, a framework where everything
fits or is thrown away.

The second best way to get better is to fail. 

Failure sharpens our senses. It gives us motivation to
make us _want something badly enough_. We are better aware of where we are
lacking and what needs to be done, what questions to ask, and what tools
to use.

Sometimes I wait for me to fail, especially when I am missing the spark.
Some part of my mind is telling me I am not doing enough, and I want to
self-destruct. I don't fail enough -- not that I _succeed_, but I'm the
middling, average guy who isn't too great and isn't too bad. 

Of late I've come to accept that this is who I am. People I think as
'more' successful must have the same thoughts as me, don't they? Are they
somehow happier than I am? I don't think so. The path of self-improvement
doesn't end with rainbows and butterflies. 

The final way to get better is to stop trying, and let it go. You'll get
better or worse or stay the same and there's nothing _you_ can do about
it. Stop wasting your time on trying to get better and just live better.


Realize that reading this for the last 5 - 10 minutes has not improved
your life even a miniscule bit. Go do something.
