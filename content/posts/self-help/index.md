## The lure of better tools 

I found myself this morning installing
[Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com/#), because there are stories of people
saying they "changed their life around" using the zettelkasten method
(here's an
[example](https://www.bryanlee.net/blog/the-life-changing-magic-of-zettelkasten)).
Apparently it's the way to become 20% smarter and win Pulitzers.

Please don't pay any attention to my cynical tone. It's because I can't
get any value from it myself. Yet. 

A great hammer in the hands of a master carpenter will save him
time and effort and possibly allow him to make better furniture than if he
didn't have it. He is understandably going to be excited. "This tool", he
says, "will allow you to make a four poster bed like never before and in
just 3 days!".

Then a poor doofus like myself  comes around with no talent in carpentry
but plenty of ambition and desire, and I think to myself: _"Hey, the
reason I am not a master carpenter is because I don't have this tool yet.
But what do you know - it's only $30, so I'm going to buy it and look at
me go!"_

So I buy the tool but I still can't make anything better than the dumb
chair I used to make before  I had the hammer. 

Eh? Where's the 4 poster bed? Where's the fame and the world's 
recognition of my talent? 

Time goes by, the hammer rusts, and in my old age I regret, "If only I had
_this other tool_, I would have been the best carpenter in the world."

You get my point. It's not the tool. It's the hand that wields, the brain
that thinks, the person who uses the tool. Advice helps, but the person
receiving advice must be ready. It's not about the advice itself.
