      <description>I found myself this morning installing Zettlr, because there are stories of people saying they &amp;ldquo;changed their life around&amp;rdquo; using the zettelkasten method (here&amp;rsquo;s an example). Apparently it&amp;rsquo;s the way to become 20% smarter and win Pulitzers.
Please don&amp;rsquo;t pay any attention to my cynical tone. It&amp;rsquo;s because I can&amp;rsquo;t get any value from it myself.
A great hammer in the hands of a master carpenter will save him time and effort and allow him to make better furniture than without it.</description>

      <description>One day in May, I was returning home from work when I saw a poster for the Seoul Marathon 2022. The event had come and gone, and I had been unaware of it.
Seoul Marathon 2022 I started running some time in June this year. I&amp;rsquo;ve made it a tradition to take a shot of whatever is in front of me when I finish my runs. I don&amp;rsquo;t think any of these shots are &amp;ldquo;special&amp;rdquo; in a visual way.</description>

      <description>While Seoul knows no sleep, my neighborhood grows quiet at night. There aren&amp;rsquo;t many people out and about. The absence of sounds of traffic enhances the peaceful feeling.
Going home after a long day at work Seoul is notorious for long work hours. Then the Government announced last year that work hours per week were to be capped at 52 hours per week.
A quiet cul-de-sac The place I live in has many &amp;ldquo;villas&amp;rdquo;, less expensive alternatives for a high-rise apartments.</description>

      <title>Conditional Happiness</title>

      <description>Swami Sarvapriyananda, my favorite teacher of philosophy, talks about why happiness conditioned on worldly events, possessions or people, is inherently sorrowful and not true happiness.
The full talk is about 3 mantras in the Katha Upanishad, where Nachiketa, a little boy given by his annoyed father to the Lord of Death, Yamaraja visits him. Yamaraja is not home when Nachiketa visits, so he grants three boons to make up for his lapse.</description>

      <description>This post originally appeared on LinkedIn. I have edited the text for readability
It&amp;rsquo;s common for employees who are leaving to send out a &amp;ldquo;Thank you and good bye&amp;rdquo; mail enmasse. Usually, this happens at Friday at 5:45 PM as everyone is winding down for the weekend.
Please don&amp;rsquo;t do this.
It&amp;rsquo;s a low effort call for attention. You feel on top of the world, your stress has evaporated, and you want to shout out your liberation from the rooftops.</description>

      <description>Will Smith begins his biography, Will, with the story of his father demolishing a 12x20 feet wall. He asks Will, 11, and his younger brother Harry to rebuild it.
Will meets this decision with stupefaction:
I remember looking at that gaping hole in excruciating disbelief. I was utterly certain that there would never be a wall there ever again.
Will and his brother worked on the wall every day, mixing concrete and carrying the buckets.</description>

      <description>The Road In &amp;ldquo;The Road&amp;rdquo;, a father and son are making their way towards the sea in a world in which an apocalyptic event has killed most living things.
It&amp;rsquo;s winter, and it&amp;rsquo;s snowing. Their clothes and shoes are threadbare. They sleep under tarpaulin on the hard ground. During their walk, they manage to find some gasoline, which is useful to build fires, to cook food, to keep warm.</description>

      <title>Using Evolutionary Algorithms for the CVRP</title>

      <description>Context Tweaking the search heuristic based on benchmark data is a necessary evil when building and testing an OR model intended for production. But this approach has a problem: we are able to beat benchmarks but are not able to consistently get acceptable results in production, where the input data can vary for each run. One solution is to train the OR model in more benchmarks, but it is expensive for businesses to create the right benchmarks and to verify results when there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of variation possible in the data, or they are not sure of what variation can potentially happen, or the amount of work that goes into building the benchmark is high.</description>

      <title>Advice for young OR professionals</title>

      <description>Introduction I love mentoring young people, but I don’t get many chances to do so. In the last few years, some of my younger colleagues have asked me questions that I’ve not answered well.
I’ve had some time recently to think about what I would say if I had the opportunity to talk to them again. I’ve written down some of these thoughts. Like most advice, it is unsolicited, so what could be better than to put it out here and let anyone who can get value out of it do so?</description>
