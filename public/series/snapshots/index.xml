      <description>One day in May, I was returning home from work when I saw a poster for the Seoul Marathon 2022. The event had come and gone, and I had been unaware of it.
Seoul Marathon 2022 I started running some time in June this year. I&amp;rsquo;ve made it a tradition to take a shot of whatever is in front of me when I finish my runs. I don&amp;rsquo;t think any of these shots are &amp;ldquo;special&amp;rdquo; in a visual way.</description>

      <description>While Seoul knows no sleep, my neighborhood grows quiet at night. There aren&amp;rsquo;t many people out and about. The absence of sounds of traffic enhances the peaceful feeling.
Going home after a long day at work Seoul is notorious for long work hours. Then the Government announced last year that work hours per week were to be capped at 52 hours per week.
A quiet cul-de-sac The place I live in has many &amp;ldquo;villas&amp;rdquo;, less expensive alternatives for a high-rise apartments.</description>
