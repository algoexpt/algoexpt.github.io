      <description>For a while I was convinced pushing weights with my noodle-like arms in the gym was the best way to get fit, but I never got into the groove of the gym. It never graduated from being a painful chore to something I enjoyed doing.
But running was different - specifically the long form. The mind was peaceful while I was pumping my legs and I was in the moment. I always run outdoors, where the wind and the scenery and the people provide variety.</description>

      <description>While Seoul knows no sleep, my neighborhood grows quiet at night. There aren&amp;rsquo;t many people out and about. The absence of sounds of traffic enhances the peaceful feeling.
Going home after a long day at work Seoul is notorious for long work hours. Then the Government announced last year that work hours per week were to be capped at 52 hours per week.
A quiet cul-de-sac The place I live in has many &amp;ldquo;villas&amp;rdquo;, less expensive alternatives for a high-rise apartments.</description>
