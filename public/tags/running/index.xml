      <description>For a while I was convinced pushing weights with my noodle-like arms in the gym was the best way to get fit, but I never got into the groove of the gym. It never graduated from being a painful chore to something I enjoyed doing.
But running was different - specifically the long form. The mind was peaceful while I was pumping my legs and I was in the moment. I always run outdoors, where the wind and the scenery and the people provide variety.</description>
