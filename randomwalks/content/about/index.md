This is the blog of Ajay Arn.

### Why?
I suppose I should have a reason for this blog to exist... but there isn't one. As someone once said, "I was so busy seeing if I could, I never stopped to think if I should". 

But it serves a purpose. It serves as a repository of my opinions that I am not too ashamed to share. Not all of them are going to be acceptable by all. Yet here they are.

In this I am inspired by luminaries such as [Paul Graham](http://paulgraham.com/) and [Joel Spolsky](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/). I might never reach the heights of clarity and vision they have, but it doesn't hurt to try.

### Randomness

Vedanta philosophy says that we are but actors on a stage. Thoughts and events occur out of our control. Yet we constantly struggle and fight to control our lives.

>न त्वं देहो न ते देहो भोक्ता कर्ता न वा भवान् ।  
> चिद्रूपोऽसि सदा साक्षी निरपेक्षः सुखं चर ॥ ४ ॥
>
> You are not the body, nor is the body yours, nor are you the doer of actions or the reaper of their consequences. You are eternally pure consciousness the witness, in need of nothing - so live happily.

[Ashtavakra Gita verse 15.4](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/ashtavakra-gita-sanskrit/d/doc345938.html)

Random walks is a reminder to me that I am *not* the actor, despite the strong and repeated illusion that I am.
