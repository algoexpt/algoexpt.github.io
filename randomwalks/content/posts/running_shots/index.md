For a while I was convinced pushing weights with my noodle-like arms in the gym was the best way to get fit, but I never got into the groove of the gym. It never graduated from being a painful chore to something I enjoyed doing.

But running was different - specifically the long form. The mind was peaceful while I was pumping my legs and I was in the moment. I always run outdoors, where the wind and the scenery and the people provide variety. And after the run, sometimes, I would feel a mild sense of [euphoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurobiological_effects_of_physical_exercise#Euphoria)  - that is a good motivator to keep running.

Before the pandemic, I was a consistent runner. My peak was a 1hr 50 min half marathon. I wanted to run the 2019 Seoul marathon - but I got injured, then COVID hit, and I was on the couch for a long time. 

One day in May, I was returning home from work when I saw a poster for the Seoul Marathon 2022. The event had come and gone, and I had been unaware of it.

I was inspired to start running again. 

I started running some time in June this year. I've made it a tradition to take a shot of whatever is in front of me when I finish my runs. I don't think any of these shots are "special" in a visual way. But it's fun to take a look anyway and reflect on some of them.

I am usually not an early riser, so a lot of my runs happen at night. I am able to unwind after the day's work.

The brown fence on the right belongs to a school. The kids in the above shot are probably going back home after extra tuition - probably from a [hagwon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagwon). Very few kids in Korea get to play after school hours - most go for more classes and tuitions. Like a hamster in a wheel, the cycle cannot stop. Because 'if other kids go, our kids must go too, else they will lose their competitiveness'. Kids lives here are unlike those in Western countries.

My usual route is a 3.75 KM round trip from my house along this road. This particular lane is spectacular in fall, when the leaves are yellow and red. The yellow [tactile paving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactile_paving) is ubiquitous in Korea. However in the many years I've lived here, I've never once seen a blind person using it. I run on it because it's in the middle and I can swerve left or right based on the other pedestrians on the footpath.

A market on my way home. Korean store fronts have plenty of neon, but the moon on this night was bright enough to shine despite all that.

This is a biking track 10 mins away from my house. On the right is an inline skating track, which I've used for interval runs.

I love running by the Han River. Even on the hottest of days there's a gentle cool breeze. There are many people walking / running / biking on this path, and  as a tall brown man huffing and puffing, I get some curious looks. I try to keep a smile on my face as I run, although I suspect I might grimace or have a frown if I am focusing hard.

On the rare occasion I run before the sun goes down, I get to see birds by the river. The two birds on the right look like [Black Tailed Gulls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-tailed_gull) . 

{{< youtube rHShsHegMBE >}}

Black Tailed Gulls are the offical mascot of [Dokdo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liancourt_Rocks), the disputed islands between Korea and Japan. There was a lot of song and dance as Korea made sure to cement its claim on the islands. This kids' song says "Dokdo is our land" and the bird features prominently.

The orange pavement for pedestrians on the right is slightly softer than the grey pavement for riders. This stretch runs straight for almost 6 km, and is great for runs of 10km or more.

On the right is a short track for running, beside a soccer field, which is beside  floodlit tennis courts. This was around 9 PM. While it's great that there's so much biking going on, the roads themselves are not safe. Commuting by bike within traffic is a risk. I envy the Dutch in this regard.

The [World Cup Bridge](https://map.naver.com/v5/entry/place/18809568?c=14124662.5258485,4515546.5956579,14,0,0,0,dh&p=Vr5FQDykm7oK06RLXYgohA,15.87,18.63,80,Float) lights up at night. There's a lot of light and color at night in Seoul, and I love it.

I'll be back with more shots from my running in November. Until then, keep moving forward.
