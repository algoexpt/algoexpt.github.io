It took a long time for me to realize that I couldn't improve myself by
reading self help books. My insecurities made me feel that others knew
more than me, if only I could be like them or get that one piece of advice
that would fill the void in my soul...

But it doesn't work like that. Nothing external can improve our lives. Not
advice, not money, not even the love of someone. _WE_ fill our own voids,
by accepting who we are and finding satisfaction in the present.

I'll stop here. These things are easy to say and bloody hard to
actually live by.

Why did I bring up the self-help stuff? Because I found myself this
morning installing [Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com/#), because there are
stories of people saying they "changed their life around" using the
zettelkasten method (here's an
[example](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23386630)), wouldn't you
know? Apparently it's the way to become 20% smarter and write amazing
books.

I am sure it is an amazing method, please don't pay any attention to my
cynical tone. If I am cynical it's because I don't believe _I am the kind
of person who's going to profit from this method_, yet. 

Why do I say this?

A great hammer in the hands of a master carpenter is going to save him
time and effort and possibly allow him to make better furniture than if he
didn't have it. He is understandably going to be excited. "This tool", he
says, "will allow you to make a four poster bed like never before and in
just 3 days!".

Then a poor schmuck like myself will come around with no talent in
carpentry but plenty of ambition and desire, and I'll think to myself:
_"hey, the reason I am not a master carpenter is because I don't have this
tool yet. But what do you know - it's only $30, so I'm going to buy it and
look at me go!"_

So I buy the tool but I still can't make anything better than the dumb
chair I used to make before  I had the hammer. Eh? Where's the 4 poster
bed? Where's the world famous recognition of my talent?

Time goes by, the hammer rusts, and in my old age I wonder if there wasn't
another tool that would have made me the best carpenter in the world.

You get my point. It's not the tool. It's the hand that wields, the brain
that thinks, the person who uses the tool.

Can't fill that void with things from outside yourself.
