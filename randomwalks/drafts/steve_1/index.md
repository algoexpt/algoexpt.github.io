Steve Jobs' Stanford commencement address ([1](https://youtu.be/UF8uR6Z6KLc), [2](https://news.stanford.edu/news/2005/june15/jobs-061505.html)) has been a source of inspiration to many, for good reason. 

As usually happens when you're in-between jobs, I was contemplating my own career, thought that it was interesting to compare my career with one of the most successful people in history through this speech.

Sometimes I have no shame.


## Dropping out

> The first story is about connecting the dots.
> 
> I dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 months, but then stayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before I really quit. So why did I drop out?
> 
> ... 
> 
> I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford, and all of my working-class parents' savings were being spent on my college tuition. After six months, I couldn't see the value in it. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out. And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life. So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK.

After I finished high school, my single mother couldn't afford to send me to an  engineering college.  I did a three-year BSc in a local college that cost us less than $5 per year. I didn't feel I had the freedom to choose. It wasn't an option for me to even *prepare* for the IIT entrance exam, because we couldn't afford the preparatory books and tutorials. 

Perhaps if he had selected a less expensive college and stuck it out like the rest of us, we would never have seen Apple Computers being born.


## Risk aversion

> The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that didn't interest me, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked interesting.

The standard of education in my college I wasn't great (as the $5 per year fee would attest). Students joined private coaching classes because the regular classes were not helping them pass the statewide exams. 

So I used the library liberally. Instead of sitting in classes, I read a ton of books. 

Unlike Steve Jobs, I didn't read books purely out of interest. I read books that would help me join a professional course after which I could get a job as a software developer. 

I had to do my best  to stop being a burden on my family.

I was risk averse and Steve Jobs was risk loving. I may have worked as hard as Steve Jobs, but I invested the effort in succeeding where the probability of failure was low. 

I had to find a way to become independent, for the sake of my self esteem and confidence. I wanted to win respect, and software development (which was booming in the late 90s) was the ticket.

## Connecting the dots 

>If I had never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class, and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do. Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college. But it was very, very clear looking backward 10 years later. 
>
>Again, you can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something â€” your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.

I am convinced that no matter what you do in life, you'll always be able to connect the dots. We are very good at constructing a narrative out of unrelated facts. Which is why games like [story dice](https://www.storycubes.com/en/) exist.

I left a secure job in Korea in 2009 because I didn't want to continue on the path I was on. I left without a plan. All I knew was "I don't want to do this anymore". 

I was in Singapore, in the library one day, killing time reading fiction. I saw a middle aged man working hard on solving some problems from a textbook. Curious, I asked him what he was doing. He said he was doing a part time Master's course, and because he was so busy during the weekdays, he came to the library in the weekends to catch up. 

It shook me - here I was, trying to kill time whereas others were out there slogging away. Inspired, I applied for a MS in Operations Research in SMU.

13 years later, here I am.

Like Steve, I could say: "If I had never left my job in Korea, I would never have gone to the library in Singapore and be inspired to achieve success in Operations Research." But... that's obvious. The dots connect if you draw a line between them.

In my humble opinion, the Mac had good typography because Steve Jobs had *good taste*. That's what inspired him to attend the calligraphy class, and later to design a beautiful system.
