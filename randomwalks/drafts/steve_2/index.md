> My second story is about love and loss.

![ Steve Jobs tries not to throw up after reading this ](stevejobs81502269-2332004628.jpg)

## Not quitting (even if you don't love it)

Jobs was fired from his job as CEO of Apple.

> So at 30 I was out. And very publicly out. What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone, and it was devastating.
> 
> ...
> 
> During the next five years, I started a company named NeXT, another company named Pixar, and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife. 
> 
> ...
> 
> In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT, I returned to Apple, and the technology we developed at NeXT is at the heart of Apple's current renaissance. And Laurene and I have a wonderful family together.

At 30, I left my job in Samsung.

During the next five years, I went on to do an MSc, that opened the doors of Operations Research to me. I joined a wonderful company called Quintiq, and I got married. And we have a wonderful family together.

> Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don't lose faith. I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did. 

Doing my MSc was hard. I was much older than my peers, and after a relatively easy working life, I found it hard to do assignments, take tests, do research. The only thing that kept me going was... I didn't know how to quit. Quitting was not an option. I had to see it through, because I had taken the leap, and there was nothing else I thought I could do.


## Finding what you love

> You've got to find what you love. And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking until you find it. Don't settle.


I didn't know what I loved. 

I picked embedded software development after I graduated - I liked learning it but it was boring to work on. 

After 6 years I picked Operations Research. It was hard to learn but it was fun to work on. 

Usually I don't have something I _love_ that I absolutely want to pursue. I was lucky to find Operations Research, but I wouldn't have found that I enjoyed it if I had dropped out during my MSc, when it _wasn't_ fun.

_Like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on_ - yes, but how do you know if the relationship is great enough to keep going? 

I've settled, several times. Each time we reach a fork in the road, we pick one and go forward, never to go back to the fork to see where the other road would take us. We take decisions with little information. Are we less happy or more happy than if we took the other road? Who knows?

There are infinite forks and infinite roads. On each one we have an opportunity to be as fulfilled and happy as we can be. And if we aren't happy, we reach a fork, we make a decision, we go forward. 

_Don't settle_, but also don't be in a permanent state of unhappiness and dissatisfaction.
